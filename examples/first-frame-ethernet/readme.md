# first-frame-ethernet sample code

## Overview

The first-frame-ethernet is a cross platform sample code that shows how to use the aditof sdk to talk to a remote ToF camera over the network.

Before running this example, make sure the [server](../../apps/server) is started on the target. For example if the ip address of the target is `192.168.1.110` the run command should be:
`./first-frame-ethernet "192.168.1.110"`
